# Fish-Prediction

The DataSet is taken from the  https://www.kaggle.com/aungpyaeap/fish-market
App is live at:    https://fishpredictor.herokuapp.com/predict

This project intends to classify the different species of fish

The dataset includes 159 Rows and 7 columns(1 is dependent variable - species)

Since species prediction is a classification based problem hence supervised learning algorithm is used. Hence, for making prediction I have used Logistics Regression only.It has 75% accuracy.
